# Omarchy theming

Omarchy themes live under `themes/<name>/` in the source tree (installed at
`/usr/share/omarchy/themes/<name>/`), with optional user themes under
`~/.config/omarchy/themes/<name>/`. A theme normally starts with a
`colors.toml`; Omarchy generates the active theme files from
`default/themed/*.tpl` when `omarchy-theme-set <name>` runs.

Beyond `colors.toml` and hand-written config overrides, a first-party theme can ship `backgrounds/` (users overlay their own via `~/.config/omarchy/backgrounds/<name>/`; the active image is the `~/.local/state/omarchy/current/background` symlink), `preview.png` and `preview-unlock.png` for the theme switcher, `icons.theme`, `keyboard.rgb`, `unlock.png`, and a `light.mode` marker file.

A theme can pair a still background with a silent intro video using matching filenames: `backgrounds/0-winding-road.webp` and `backgrounds/intros/0-winding-road.mp4`. The video plays automatically at login and when switching to that theme with this background selected. No registration, checksum file or manual setting is needed. Supported video extensions are `mp4`, `m4v`, `mov`, `webm`, `mkv` and `avi`. Intro videos stay inside the nested `intros/` directory so the background picker does not list them as looping wallpapers. An image selected from another directory looks for its intro in that directory's own `intros/`, so a same-named custom image cannot inherit a theme's video.

Aim for a video between five and seven seconds long that opens on its scene setup and ends on the matching still. The shell provides the opening crossfade, so an added fade from black is unnecessary. OWE owns decoding, mute and the handoff back to that image. The theme picker prepares the highlighted theme's remembered intro offscreen, paused at its opening frame. OWE keeps one prepared clip and an idle renderer for up to one minute, then releases them. A theme switch also starts preparation while its templates render; OWE compares the selected video with the prepared clip before resuming it. Older OWE versions use the ordinary startup path. Hyprland and the SDDM greeter use a black compositor background. On a fresh login, the persistent shell host keeps an opaque black cover above the bar and wallpaper until the bar has loaded and OWE has a moving video frame, then fades both in together over 420 ms. Hyprland initializes with a transparent cursor so its visibility polling cannot expose a pointer in the first frames. The temporary Xcursor theme stays private to the compositor; applications inherit the normal cursor environment. The opening fade restores the selected cursor and settings. Shell restarts and a fifteen-second compositor timeout recover a cursor left hidden by an interrupted startup. With intros disabled or unavailable, it waits for the still to be ready instead. A ten-second deadline releases the cover if a missing wallpaper or failed plugin never becomes ready. Ordinary shell restarts preload the selected still alongside the bar without mapping that login cover. Login intros use the Hyprland instance signature, so logging out and back in plays the intro again. The launcher consumes the current session before waiting up to five seconds for OWE. Shell restarts and a daemon starting after that window cannot play a delayed intro. Theme switches synchronize OWE with the selected image and use its first-frame start mode. An interrupted video supplies its currently playing frame as the outgoing snapshot. Rapid selections wait for the previous opening fade to finish before capturing it. Theme replacement and playback wait for the outgoing cover to decode and reach the compositor on every screen. A persistent layer holds that outgoing wallpaper until OWE hides the shell background and reports a ready video with an advancing playback position and no outgoing still transition, then crossfades it over 420 ms while applying the new bar palette. The shell retains its background service and decoded wallpaper while it is hidden, so handing the still back does not recreate them. When OWE hands it back, the shell re-reads the background link and reloads the still instantly, because the theme switch replaced the files behind the path it held. App retints wait until the opening crossfade completes, with a three-second bound, so they do not compete with its first frames. The compositor reload waits until playback finishes because reloading Hyprland pauses video presentation. A superseded intro skips that reload. Failed playback releases the pending palette, and a newer theme invalidates the older handoff. Refreshing a theme, headless setup, and cycling backgrounds within the same theme do not trigger intros. Toggle > Animations suppresses playback along with the other animations. The `omarchy theme bg intro toggle` command can toggle intros separately.

A theme installed from a git repo is held to a much shorter list; see [What an installed theme may not ship](#what-an-installed-theme-may-not-ship).

## Theme activation flow

`omarchy-theme-set <name>` builds a clean staging directory at
`~/.local/state/omarchy/current/next-theme`:

1. Copy the first-party theme from `themes/<name>/`.
2. Overlay `~/.config/omarchy/themes/<name>/`, in full when the user wrote it and filtered when it came from a git repo, naming anything it dropped on stderr.
3. If needed, generate `colors.toml` from `alacritty.toml`.
4. Run `omarchy-theme-set-templates` to render templates into the staging
   theme.
5. Move the staging theme into `~/.local/state/omarchy/current/theme`, write
   `~/.local/state/omarchy/current/theme.name`, and notify the running shell.

Template rendering only happens when the staged theme has `colors.toml`.
Existing files are never overwritten by a template, so a hand-written
`themes/<name>/shell.toml` or `hyprland.lua` wins over
`default/themed/shell.toml.tpl` or `hyprland.lua.tpl`.

User templates in `~/.config/omarchy/themed/*.tpl` are processed before the
built-in templates. If a user template has the same output filename as a
built-in template, the built-in output is skipped.

After activation, `omarchy-theme-set` fires the `theme-set` hook
(`~/.config/omarchy/hooks/theme-set*`, theme name in `$1`) and dispatches a
parallel retint of running apps — terminals, Hyprland, btop, browser, editors,
and the rest of the `post_theme_commands` list in `bin/omarchy-theme-set`.
Making a new app follow theme changes means adding its restart/retint command
to that list. Runs serialize on a `flock`, so scripted theme changes queue
instead of racing.

Last, it starts `omarchy-theme-set-herdr-machines` detached. That command sets the same theme on every enabled `herdr machine list` target that runs Omarchy, over SSH inside the remote's live Hyprland session, and logs each machine's result to `~/.local/state/omarchy/theme-set-herdr-machines.log`. Sync is off by default. The `herdr-theme-sync` toggle turns it on, and a machine only sends and accepts themes while it is on. A mirrored change carries `OMARCHY_THEME_SYNC_FROM`, so the receiving machine never sends it on.

## What an installed theme may not ship

`themes/<name>/` in this repo is Omarchy's own code and is trusted. So is a theme the user wrote by hand in `~/.config/omarchy/themes/<name>/`: it is their machine and their file, and both stage in full.

`omarchy theme install <url>` is different. It clones a stranger's git repo straight into that same directory, so the contents are whatever the theme author pushed. `omarchy-theme-set` tells the two apart the way `omarchy-theme-extras` already does — a `.git` directory means it was cloned, while a plain directory or a symlink to a working copy is the user's own — and from a cloned one it drops only what can run code:

- any `*.lua` — Hyprland `require`s a theme's `hyprland.lua` and `gum_env.lua` at login, and Neovim loads its `neovim.lua` at startup
- `alacritty.toml`, `foot.ini`, `ghostty.conf`, `kitty.conf` — each names the program the terminal launches
- `vscode.json` — names the extension `omarchy-theme-set-vscode` installs, and a VS Code extension is arbitrary JavaScript

Symlinks are dropped with them, at any depth; in a cloned theme they point wherever the theme author chose. Everything a cloned theme ships that is colour is kept, including files Omarchy would otherwise have generated — `btop.theme`, `chromium.theme`, `helix.toml`, `shell.toml`, `icons.theme`, `keyboard.rgb` and the rest — so a theme can still say exactly how it wants each app to look. What is dropped gets generated from `default/themed/*.tpl` instead, and is named on stderr.

A denylist is only right while it is maintained. Adding a template for another terminal, or for another editor that loads Lua, means adding it to `INSTALLED_THEME_DENIED` in `bin/omarchy-theme-set`; `test/shell.d/theme-staging-test.sh` fails on any `default/themed/*.tpl` whose output is recorded as neither code nor colour, so a new template cannot be added without that decision being made.

A theme predating `colors.toml` is not left without a palette: its `alacritty.toml` is read through `omarchy-theme-colors-from-alacritty` into a scratch directory and only the resulting `colors.toml` is staged, so the colors survive and the terminal config does not.

The restriction lives in `omarchy-theme-set` rather than in `omarchy-theme-install` on purpose. Filtering at staging also covers themes installed before the rule existed and files a theme gains later through `omarchy theme update`.

What this does not cover: a theme distributed as an archive rather than a git repo, extracted into `~/.config/omarchy/themes/` by hand, is indistinguishable from one the user wrote and stages in full. `omarchy theme install` only takes git URLs, so the supported path is always filtered, but the check is a statement about where a theme came from and not a sandbox.

## `colors.toml`

`colors.toml` provides the palette keys used by templates. Keys are grouped
semantic-first: accent/selection/muted, then the backgrounds, then the
foregrounds, then the named colors:

```toml
mode = "dark"

accent = "#7aa2f7"
selection = "#292e42"
muted = "#414868"

background = "#1a1b26"
dark_background = "#13141c"
darker_background = "#0e0e14"
lighter_background = "#24283b"

foreground = "#a9b1d6"
dark_foreground = "#565f89"
light_foreground = "#b4bee6"
bright_foreground = "#c0caf5"

red = "#f7768e"
blue = "#7aa2f7"
```

Any key can be referenced from a template with `{{ key }}`. The foundational
shell palette is loaded from:

- `foreground` — primary readable text color
- `background` — primary background color
- `accent` — preferred when present; otherwise some places fall back to
  `color4`
- `muted` — de-emphasized elements (comments, placeholders, dividers); also
  serves as ANSI `color8`
- `red` / `color1` — populate the shell's urgent role; there is no `urgent`
  palette key (one defined in `colors.toml` is ignored)

Themes and user templates using the legacy short names remain supported.
Canonical names take precedence when both forms are defined, and resolved
canonical values are also exposed through their legacy names:

| Canonical | Legacy |
|-----------|--------|
| `background` | `bg` |
| `dark_background` | `dark_bg` |
| `darker_background` | `darker_bg` |
| `lighter_background` | `lighter_bg` |
| `foreground` | `fg` |
| `dark_foreground` | `dark_fg` |
| `light_foreground` | `light_fg` |
| `bright_foreground` | `bright_fg` |

The neutral ramp is centered on `background -> bright_foreground`. Dark themes
should read from darkest to lightest; light themes should read from lightest to
darkest. Terminal and editor cursors use `bright_foreground`; there is no
separate cursor palette key. `selection` is the text-selection background stop
in that ramp; Omarchy derives `selection_background = selection` and
`selection_foreground = bright_foreground`. Use
`omarchy dev theme-preview [theme]` to inspect that ramp, including
`dark_background`, `darker_background`, and a selected-text sample.

## Template placeholders

Templates are plain files ending in `.tpl`. `omarchy-theme-set-templates`
replaces placeholders with values from `colors.toml`.

### Color placeholders

For a color key such as `accent = "#7aa2f7"`:

| Placeholder | Output |
|-------------|--------|
| `{{ accent }}` | `#7aa2f7` |
| `{{ accent_strip }}` | `7aa2f7` |
| `{{ accent_rgb }}` | `122,162,247` |

### Color mixing

`mix`, `mix_strip`, and `mix_rgb` blend two hex colors by a fraction or
percentage:

```text
{{ mix background foreground 15% }}
{{ mix_strip background accent 0.35 }}
{{ mix_rgb color0 color7 50 }}
```

### Gradient helpers

Some theme keys can be either a solid color or a Hyprland-style gradient:

```toml
hyprland_active_border = "rgba(33ccffee) rgba(00ff99ee) 45deg"
```

Gradient helper placeholders understand those values:

| Helper | Use | Example output |
|--------|-----|----------------|
| `{{ hypr_gradient hyprland_active_border accent }}` | Hyprland Lua config | `{ colors = { "rgba(33ccffee)", "rgba(00ff99ee)" }, angle = 45 }` |
| `{{ shell_gradient hyprland_active_border accent }}` | shell border tokens | `rgba(33ccffee) rgba(00ff99ee) 45deg` |
| `{{ gradient_start hyprland_active_border accent }}` | flat-color-only consumers | `#33ccff` |

The second argument is a fallback. For example,
`{{ shell_gradient hyprland_active_border accent }}` means: use
`hyprland_active_border` if the theme defines it; otherwise use `accent`.
The helper does not choose the first color unless you use `gradient_start`.

## `shell.toml`

`shell.toml` contains shell surface roles, control states, spacing, typography,
and bar sizing. The default generated file comes from
`default/themed/shell.toml.tpl`.

Themes can override the entire generated file by shipping `shell.toml`, or just
one section by shipping `shell.<section>.toml`. For example,
`shell.lock.toml` replaces only the `[lock]` section after the default
`shell.toml` has been generated:

```toml
text        = "#ffffff"
placeholder = "#ffffff"
border      = "#ffffff"
```

The filename decides the target section, so the `[lock]` header is optional.

The running shell reads `shell.toml` into two QML singletons:

- `Color` for palette and surface roles like `Commons.Color.menu.border`.
- `Style` for controls, spacing, font scale, corner radius, and bar sizing.

### Borders

Shell border tokens accept either a solid color or a gradient in the same key:

```toml
[notifications]
border = "#7aa2f7"
```

or:

```toml
[notifications]
border = "rgba(33ccffee) rgba(00ff99ee) 45deg"
```

Do not add a separate `border-gradient` key for new themes. The parser still
accepts `border-gradient` and `*-border-gradient` for compatibility with older
configs, but the canonical form is the border key itself.

Border alphas apply to solid borders and to every gradient stop:

```toml
[notifications]
border       = "rgba(33ccffee) rgba(00ff99ee) 45deg"
border-alpha = 0.8
```

If a color stop already includes alpha, the stop alpha and `border-alpha` are
combined.

### Border widths

Border widths accept CSS-style lists:

```toml
border-width = 2          # all sides
border-width = "2 4"      # top/bottom, right/left
border-width = "2 4 6"    # top, right/left, bottom
border-width = "2 4 6 8"  # top, right, bottom, left
```

Per-side keys override the list:

```toml
[notifications]
border-width = 2
border-width-left = 6
```

That gives notifications a 2px border on the top, right, and bottom, and a 6px
left edge.

State-specific borders follow the same pattern. A selected menu row can use a
different width from the card border:

```toml
[menu]
selected-border = "accent"
selected-border-width = "1 1 1 4"
```

For state-specific surfaces such as lock and polkit, the token name prefixes
the width key:

```toml
[lock]
border-active = "rgba(33ccffee) rgba(00ff99ee) 45deg"
border-active-width-left = 6
```

### Control borders

`[controls]` governs shared controls such as buttons, dropdowns, text fields,
toggles, and cursor rows. Each state has a fill color, optional border value,
border width, and border alpha:

```toml
[controls]
normal-color        = "#a9b1d6"
normal-border       = "#a9b1d6"
normal-border-width = 1
normal-border-alpha = 0.4

hover-cursor-color        = "#a9b1d6"
hover-cursor-border       = "#a9b1d6"
hover-cursor-border-width = 1
hover-cursor-border-alpha = 0.25
```

The `*-border` keys can also be gradients:

```toml
[controls]
focus-border = "rgba(33ccffee) rgba(00ff99ee) 45deg"
focus-border-width = "2 2 2 4"
```

Set a border width to `0` to keep the fill but remove that state border.

### Surface sections

Common shell sections include:

- `[bar]`
- `[controls]`
- `[popups]`
- `[tooltip]`
- `[notifications]`
- `[launcher]`
- `[menu]`
- `[polkit]`
- `[lock]`
- `[image-picker]`
- `[spacing]`
- `[font]`

Clipboard and emojis inherit menu tokens. Popups are used by bar flyouts,
dropdowns, OSD, and popup cards.

## QML border API

Plugin and shell QML should use `BorderSurface` for theme-aware borders:

```qml
import qs.Commons
import qs.Commons as Commons
import qs.Ui

BorderSurface {
  color: Commons.Color.popups.background
  borderSpec: Border.surfaceSpec("popups", "border", Commons.Color.popups.border, 2)
  padding: Style.spacing.popupPadding

  Item {
    anchors.fill: parent
    anchors.topMargin: parent.contentTopInset
    anchors.rightMargin: parent.contentRightInset
    anchors.bottomMargin: parent.contentBottomInset
    anchors.leftMargin: parent.contentLeftInset
  }
}
```

Use `Border.surfaceSpec(section, token, fallbackColor, fallbackWidth, alphaKey)`
for shell theme tokens (the optional `alphaKey` names the alpha token, e.g.
`"border-alpha"`), `Border.controlSpec(state, foreground, accent, urgent)` for
shared controls, and `Border.flat(color, width)` for a deliberate local border
that should not be overridden by the active theme. `Commons.Color.<section>.border` is the
flat first-stop color for consumers that cannot render full border specs.

## Hyprland templates

Hyprland theme output is generated from `default/themed/hyprland.lua.tpl`.
Use `hypr_gradient` for border values because Hyprland's Lua config wants a
Lua string for solid colors and a Lua table for gradients:

```lua
local active_border_color = {{ hypr_gradient hyprland_active_border accent }}
```

For a solid fallback this renders:

```lua
local active_border_color = "#7aa2f7"
```

For a gradient it renders:

```lua
local active_border_color = { colors = { "rgba(33ccffee)", "rgba(00ff99ee)" }, angle = 45 }
```

## Adding or overriding theme files

- Add palette values to `themes/<name>/colors.toml`.
- Hand-written overrides work everywhere except a `.lua`, a terminal config or a `vscode.json` in a theme cloned from a git repo; see [What an installed theme may not ship](#what-an-installed-theme-may-not-ship).
- Prefer generated files when the theme can be expressed with templates.
- Add a hand-written file in `themes/<name>/` only when that theme needs to
  override the generated output entirely.
- Add a new built-in template under `default/themed/<file>.tpl` when every
  theme should generate that file.
- Add a user-wide template under `~/.config/omarchy/themed/<file>.tpl` when a
  local customization should apply across themes.

When changing templates or theme helpers, run focused tests such as:

```bash
./test/cli
./test/shell
```
